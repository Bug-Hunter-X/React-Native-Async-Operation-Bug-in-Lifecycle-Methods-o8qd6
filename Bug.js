In React Native, a less common but frustrating bug can arise from improper handling of asynchronous operations within lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` or `componentWillUnmount`.  If you perform a network request or other asynchronous task and the component unmounts before the operation completes, you might encounter errors.  For instance, trying to update state or access a component that no longer exists can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
